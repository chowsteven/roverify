# roverify

A Spotify-clone (kind of).  
By kind of, I mean that the user must upload their own audio files before streaming.

Why? ...

Created with React, Express, MongoDB, NodeJS, Cloudinary, and TailwindCSS.

### TODO

- Add multi-upload
- Add playlist shuffling
- Add cancel buttons to edit fields
- Add colors/update design
- Protect frontend routes
